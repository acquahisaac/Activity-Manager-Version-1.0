To start a new Laravel application from a GitHub repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project. Run the following command to clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Activity-Manager-Version-1.0.git
Replace your-username with the actual username or organization name on GitHub.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
After cloning the repository, navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Activity-Manager-Version-1.0
3. Install Composer Dependencies:
Ensure you have Composer installed on your machine. Install the PHP dependencies using Composer:

bash
Copy code
composer install
If the project requires the maatwebsite/excel package and it's not already included, you can install it with:

bash
Copy code
composer require maatwebsite/excel
4. Copy the .env File:
Laravel requires a .env file for environment-specific configurations. If the .env file is not included in the repository, create one by copying the .env.example file:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
5. Generate an Application Key:
Generate a new application key for your Laravel application. This key is used to encrypt user sessions and other sensitive data:

bash
Copy code
php artisan key:generate
